This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Ruby related to assigning values within getter methods.  The issue arises when using the assignment operator (`=`) directly within a getter method, unexpectedly modifying the instance variable instead of raising an error or returning a value.  The bug.rb file shows the issue and bugSolution.rb presents a solution.  The solution demonstrates how to prevent this type of direct modification in getter methods.
